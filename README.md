# Hey There!
Welcome to my repository!
## Linear Regression Task:
Please refer to the .ipynb notebook for the complete linear regression model.
## Bonus Task (Work in Progress):
The bonus task's output has been saved in the 'output.csv' file.
## Logistic Regression Task:
The logistic regression task output and programme are in the .ipynb notebook.
## K-Means Clustering Task:
K-Means clustering, including PCA dimension reduction, has been implemented in the corresponding .ipynb notebook. I've put a recording of the movable graph as a .webm file.
## Decision Tree Task:
I'd like to improve the accuracy more, but the best model I've come up with so far has been stored in the .ipynb notebook.
## Ensemble Methods Task:
Ensemble methods like boosting, bagging and random forests.
